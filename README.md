### The Problem
When enabling 2FA for online accounts oftentimes you'll receive recovery codes that can be used in the event that your 2FA authenticator can't be accessed. Additionally, when setting up 2FA you can also save the TOTP shared secret key (oftentimes the QR code that gets scanned) which can be used in the future to set up TOTP again for a specific account on an authenticator app without needing to reset 2FA on the account. The safest method of storing both the recovery and setup codes is to first encrypt the 2FA codes, then store the encrypted files offline across multiple hard drives; to make this process easier, the `encrypt.sh` and `decrypt.sh` scripts in this repo will compress all relevant 2FA codes into a single encrypted zip file that can be stored across multiple hard drives and later decrypted/decompressed.

### Retrieving the Scripts
It is important to note that both the encrypt and decrypt scripts come with self cleanup and will auto-generate the respective encrypt/decrypt script depending on the current state of the 2FA codes. For example, if you're encrypting your 2FA codes, `encrypt.sh` will automatically generate `decrypt.sh` if it detects that it's not in the current directory where the encrypt script was run; likewise, if you're decrypting your 2FA codes, `decrypt.sh` will automatically generate `encrypt.sh` if it detects that it's not  in the current directory where the decrypt script was run. 

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zakattack9/encrypt-2FA-codes/master/encrypt.sh -o encrypt.sh && chmod +x encrypt.sh

# it is optional to pull down the decrypt script since encrypt.sh will automatically do this
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zakattack9/encrypt-2FA-codes/master/decrypt.sh -o decrypt.sh && chmod +x decrypt.sh
```

### Running the Scripts
By default, the encrypted zip file is called `backup_codes.zip`. When encrypting, `encrypt.sh` will automatically look for `./recovery_codes` and `./setup_codes` directories to compress/encrypt.

```shell
# to run the encrypt script with the above naming conventions
# it will ask to enter the directory name if the naming conventions aren't used
./encrypt.sh

# to run the decrypt script with the above naming convention
# it will ask to enter the zip filename if the naming convention isn't used
./decrypt.sh

# alternatively, run the decrypt script by passing in a specific zip filename
./decrypt.sh not_named_backup_codes.zip
```

### For MacOS
7-zip is used in these scripts to encrypt the files with AES256 which requires 7z to be installed for MacOS machines. With `brew`, the `p7zip` package can be installed using the following commands.
```shell
brew update
brew install p7zip
# installs 7z, 7za, and 7zr
```

### TODO
- add ability to pass in zip filename to encrypt script
- hide typed in encrypt password and add another prompt to verify typed in password
- ensure the entered encrypt password is not visible in `.history`
